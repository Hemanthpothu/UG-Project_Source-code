        <h2>MORPHOLOGY</h2>
        <p>
        <div class="space">It is much branched small herb and 30 to 75 cm in height. All parts of tulsi are used in
            medicine, especially fresh and dried leaves. Leaves are oblong, acute with entire or serrate margin,
            pubescent on both sides and minutely gland-dotted, The leaves are green in colour with aromatic flavour and
            slightly pungent taste. </div>
        <div class="space">Flowers are purplish in colour in the form of racemes. Nutlets are subglobose,
            slightly compressed, pale brown or red in colour. Seeds are reddish-black and subglobose.</div>
        <div class="space"> Tulsi leaf is dorsiventral. Stomata are of diacytic type, par-ticularly abundant on lower
            surface. Epidermal cells are wavy walled with thin cuticle. A single layer of elongated palisade cells is
            present below upper epidermis. Mesophyll consists of four to six layers of spongy parenchymatous cells with
            intercellular spaces and oil glands. </div>
        <div class="space"> TLeaf bears both covering and glandular trichomes; covering trichomes, uniseriate,
            multicellular and often very long (100–400 μ). Glandular trichomes are sessile with radiate head composed of
            eight cells with common cuticle forming a bladder, typical labiate type trichomes. A few glandular trichomes
            with unicellular stalk and a spherical unicellular head also occur.</div>
